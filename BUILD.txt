How to build libelf and libdwarf on Linux based platforms
=========================================================
1) Make sure these tools are installed:

    scons
    m4
    gcc/g++

2) Go inside the folder you want to build

    $ cd libdwarf

3) Execute the following commands to build all configurations

    $ scons                         # debug x64 binaries
    $ scons -Q arch=x86             # debug x86 binaries
    $ scons -Q release=1            # release x64 binaries
    $ scons -Q release=1 arch=x86   # release x86 binaries

4) Optionally, you may pass build name. Default name is 'CentOS6.2'

    $ scons -Q buildroot=Ubuntu15.04

5) All binaries generated by above commands are stored at:

    ./Build/<buildroot>/<x86|x86_64>/<debug|release>/lib/
